# Quantum-Image-Processing-Algorithms-in-Tensorflow
This project to develop Quantum Image processing algorithms in Tensorflow

The following will not be the part of this project as the algorithms designed for Quantum Camera based images (Real Quantum Images)

1. convert classical images to quantum images
2. Operate Classical Images in Quantum manner
3. Considering Real part of the values and avoiding complex values
